<h1>Turtle Race</h1>
This Python program simulates a turtle race using the Turtle graphics library. You can guess which turtle will win, and the program will tell you if you're correct.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Python 3.x installed
Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository or download the Python script.</li>
<li>Open the script in a Python IDE or text editor.</li>
<li>Run the script.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>When the program starts, a window will appear, and you'll be prompted to guess which turtle (Red, Orange, or Blue) will win the race. Enter your guess in the dialog box that appears and click "OK."</li>
  <li>The turtles will start moving, and the race will begin.</li>
  <li>Once one of the turtles reaches or crosses the finish line (marked by a green line on the screen), the race will end.</li>
  <li>The program will display the result:
    <ul>
      <li>If your guess matches the winning turtle, you'll see a message saying you've won.</li>
      <li>If your guess is incorrect, you'll see a message saying you've lost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Customization</h2>
You can customize the race by changing the following variables in the code:
<ul>
  <li>y_position: Adjust the starting positions of the turtles on the Y-axis.</li>
  <li>colors: Change the colors of the turtles.</li>
  <li>random.randint(1, 5): Adjust the range to control the speed of the turtles.</li>
  <li>Feel free to modify other aspects of the program to suit your preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
